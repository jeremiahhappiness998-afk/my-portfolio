# Happiness Godknows Jeremiah – Portfolio

A modern, responsive **static portfolio website** built to showcase my work as a web developer. The site is fully optimized for search engines (SEO), features a clean dark-themed UI, and includes a functional contact form powered by FormSubmit. It is deployed on Vercel and can be easily customized or forked.
